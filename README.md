# Quantitative Realism
 A computational social science project that explores the behavior of political power structures

## Basic Idea

This project explores a computational model of international relations, called **quantitative realism**, in which the international system is represented as an abstract power structure, like this:

<img src="https://github.com/mpoulshock/QuantitativeRealism/blob/main/Supplementary%20Materials/Wiki%20Images/Introduction/Random%20power%20structure.png" width="250" />

In this diagram, larger nodes are more powerful, solid lines represent cooperation, and dashed lines represent conflict.

The major questions are:

1. How do power structures evolve in time?
1. Does the abstract model say anything meaningful about historical power struggles?
1. What is the nature of the current world power structure?

This project uses the Wolfram Language and C++ to explore these questions.
