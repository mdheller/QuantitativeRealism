# QuantitativeRealism
 A computational social science project that explores the behavior of political power structures

## Basic Idea

This project explores a computational model of international relations, called **quantitative realism**, in which the international system is represented as an abstract power structure, like this:

The basic questions are:

1. How do power structures evolve in time?
1. Does the abstract model say anything meaningful about historical power struggles?
1. What is the nature of the current world power structure?
